**Some recommendations to grow pizza business:**

Optimize Staffing: Given that Thursday, Friday, and Saturday are the busiest days, the customer might consider optimizing staffing levels during these periods. Ensuring sufficient staff during peak hours can enhance customer service and reduce waiting times, contributing to a positive customer experience.

Promote Classic Pizzas: Since Classic pizzas contribute significantly to sales and total orders, the customer can focus on promoting and marketing this category. Special deals or promotions on Classic pizzas during peak hours might attract more customers and boost sales.

Size-Based Promotions: Considering that large size pizzas generate the maximum revenue, the customer could introduce size-based promotions, encouraging customers to upgrade to larger pizzas. This strategy can capitalize on the preference for larger pizzas and potentially increase the average order value.

Popular Pizza Specials: Leveraging the popularity of the Classic Deluxe, BBQ Chicken, and Hawaiian pizzas, the customer can create bundled promotions or combo deals featuring these best-selling items. This can attract customers looking for a variety of options and maximize sales of the most popular choices.

Revise Menu Strategy: Given that the Brie Carrie Pizza has the lowest share in total sales, the customer may want to reconsider its place in the menu. It could be replaced with a new pizza option or repositioned to boost its appeal.

Customer Feedback: Engage with customers to gather feedback on their pizza preferences. Understanding customer preferences can help in creating new offerings or refining existing ones to meet customer expectations.

Online Ordering Convenience: If not already in place, enhancing the online ordering experience, especially during peak hours, can streamline the ordering process and improve overall customer satisfaction.

Marketing during Peak Hours: Strategically time marketing efforts, especially promotions and advertisements, during the identified peak hours. This can capitalize on customer decision-making during these periods.
